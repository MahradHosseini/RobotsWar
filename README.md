METU NCC CNG462: Artificial Intelligence Assignment 1  
Using Python 3.12.2 Interpreter  
JetBrains PyCharm IDE  

Install the following dependencies before running the program:  
- matplotlib

The program will create a visualized map of your coordinates and nodes in them. Then apply A* search to find the shortest paths and use them for other search algorithms while creating a minimap.
On the red graph map, each coordinate (x,y) represents a square in the black&white map.

How to use:  
Edit the map.txt file as you wish to make your desirable map. For each y-axis value you should specify the range of white blocks in form of y-axis: x-start - x-end, skip the blank rows. Also specify as many nodes as you wish under node_coordinates section.  
The system will check for possible errors and let you know.
Example map.txt is given.
